# Optimized-Threadpool-ML-Image-Processing
This project involves creating an Optimized "ThreadPool" implementation for image processing as part of a pre-processing step for machine learning. The project required the completion of ThreadPool-related functions using Pthread condition variables, with each image being processed using one core per thread.
